# Sort-Files-
In this python project, we are sorting different files in different sorted folders with respect to their individual extension.
This project sorts all the files present in the directory into different folders based on the extensions.


I have also provided the .exe file of the project just the convenience.

To run the project you can run the .exe file and provide the location of path where you need to sort the files.
